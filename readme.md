# URL-Launcher Chrome Extension

This is a customizable URL-launcher Chrome Extension. 
Basic HTML, Javascript and CSS has been used to create this Chrome Extension.

It can be modified to add and remove your own URLS. 
The URLs are segregated into different categories.
There is also a notification panel inside the extension.

There are 2 additional features in the extension:

1. The extension reminds you via the notification panel to update your linkedIn daily between 7pm to 10 pm.
   Also the LinkedIn icon turns red during this time interval. The URL for which you can set the notification and the time/day    setting for the notification is customizable.

2. The extension reminds you via the notification panel as well as a popup to practise a LeetCode programming problem.
   Also the LeetCode Icon turns red during this time interval. Once you click on the open LeetCode button on the popup, the      notification reminding you to solve a LeetCode problem in the extension goes away.
   The URL for which you can set the notification and the time/day setting for the notification is customizable.
